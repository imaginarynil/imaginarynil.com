            <p>
                I am a software developer who focuses on website development using ASP.NET. I am currently learning
                how to draw anime-styled illustrations using Krita.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>Here is a list of websites that I used as inspirations for my website</p>
            <ul class="unordered-list">
                <li>https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web</li>
                <li>https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/</li>
                <li>https://en.bem.info/methodology/quick-start/</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            At first, I did not know how to properly name CSS classes and structure HTML tags so that my code is
            meaningful and will not cause unnecessary problems in the future. I found BEM when I was searching on
            Google, and I think it is a good enough method because it provides a clear structure on how to manage HTML
            tags and CSS classes. The docs gives examples, such as the website itself and basic cases when to apply use
            certain approaches. Also, the naming scheme is cool, so I like that too.
